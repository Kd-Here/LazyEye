## What is Lazy Eye? 👁️

Lazy Eye, also known as Amblyopia, is a vision condition where one eye has reduced vision compared to the other eye. It commonly occurs in childhood and can be caused by issues like crossed or misaligned eyes (strabismus) or significant refractive errors. If left untreated, lazy eye can result in long-term vision problems.

## How Can Games Help Cure Lazy Eye? 🎯

Lazy eye can be effectively treated through vision therapy, and one engaging method is by incorporating eye tracking games into the therapy process. Playing these games stimulates the weaker eye, encourages both eyes to work together, and improves binocular vision. With consistent practice and guidance from eye care professionals, these games can contribute to the improvement of visual acuity and overall vision.

## How Games Boost Vision Improvement 🎮
Playing eye tracking games stimulates neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to adapt and form new connections. These games engage visual processing and eye coordination, promoting stronger neural pathways for vision.

### Short-term Benefits
In the initial stages of therapy, playing games for just 5 minutes can enhance vision for approximately 20 minutes. This "transfer of training effect" demonstrates the brain's responsiveness to targeted tasks.

### Long-term Potential
Consistent game practice can lead to extended periods of improved vision beyond the initial 20 minutes. Neuroplasticity allows the brain to rewire and strengthen connections, fostering long-term visual improvement.

It's important to consult with eye care professionals for comprehensive treatment and personalized guidance throughout the therapy process.
